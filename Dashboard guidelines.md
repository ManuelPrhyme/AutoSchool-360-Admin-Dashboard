## 1. Start with Purpose (Medium, DataCamp)

Before adding anything to a page, answer:

- **Who** opens this page (vendor admin vs. delegate)?
- **Why** — what decision do they make here?
- **What** few metrics support that decision?
- **How** — monitoring at a glance, or drill-down?
- **When** — checked daily? Real-time?

**Rule:** If a widget can't be mapped to a decision, it doesn't ship. A dashboard should
answer the user's top two questions in ten seconds; otherwise it is too complex.

Dashboard archetypes (DataCamp) and how this app maps to them:

| Type | Use in this app |
|---|---|
| Tactical (daily execution) | Schools list, Codes list — progress vs. targets, actions close to data |
| Operational (live monitoring) | Wallet & Gas — big status numbers, freshness stamp |
| Analytical (deep dive) | Generate / Renew — forms and drill-down detail |

## 2. Visual Hierarchy — the Inverted Pyramid (DataCamp, Medium)

Structure every page top-to-bottom by urgency:

1. **Top — Status/KPIs** ("are we good?"): KPI strip via `.kpi-card`, headline numbers
   first. KPIs live in the top-left hot zone (Z-scanning pattern).
2. **Middle — Trends/comparisons** ("why?"): tables and cards that explain movement.
3. **Bottom — Details & actions** ("what now?"): row-level detail, contextual buttons
   (e.g. "Regenerate code" only on expired schools, "Deactivate" only on valid codes).

**Layout rules:**
- Simple grid, even gutters, aligned cards (`grid gap-2`), no broken grids.
- Group related items; separate unrelated ones with space, not lines.
- Primary KPIs at the top; supporting stats below.
- Progressive disclosure: headline first, drill-down for detail; hide rarely-used
  controls behind a clear "More"/menu.
- **Filters sit above the content** they control, with short plain labels
  (DataCamp). The codes page uses a 3-tab segmented control (All / Unused /
  Consumed) that: shows each tab's result count before you tap, keeps the applied
  state visible (`aria-selected` + filled brand chip), uses 44px+ touch targets,
  and explains an empty result instead of rendering a blank region. Filtering
  logic lives in `src/lib/kpi.ts` (`applyCodeFilter`), so the same rules power
  mobile cards and the desktop table.
- **KPI cards are actions, not just numbers.** On the codes page each KPI card is
  a button that applies its matching filter and clears any active search — the
  headline connects directly to the workflow (Medium: "direct connection between
  data and potential actions"). The Total card also reports how many rows are
  currently shown.
- **Search narrows, never hides.** A single search input filters by code text or
  school display name (case-insensitive, via `searchCodes` in `kpi.ts`), composes
  with the state filter (filter first, then search), and its empty state names
  the query so users understand what happened.
- **Persist chosen filters** across page switches and reloads
  (`localStorage`, validated on read with `parseCodeFilter` so tampered or
  unknown values fall back to `All` — never trust storage round-trips).
  Persistence is best-effort: private-mode storage failures degrade silently to
  defaults. The search query persists the same way
  (`autoschool360.codesSearch`), so a reload keeps the narrowed view.
- **Offer an escape hatch.** Whenever the view is narrowed (non-default filter
  or active search), show a one-tap **"✕ Clear filter & search"** reset button
  (`hasActiveViewState` in `kpi.ts` gates its visibility — no dead controls on
  the pristine view). DataCamp: "five precise filters beat fifteen vague
  ones" — and every applied filter must be easy to undo.

## 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design (Tableau, Toptal)

Mobile is a first-class target, not an afterthought — build it together with desktop.

- **Portrait-first, vertical scroll** (Tableau): optimize for one-column portrait
  layouts; height may grow as long as scrolling stays vertical.
- **Range/flexible sizing** (Tableau): fluid widths, never fixed pixel layouts.
- **Single code set** (Toptal): one responsive codebase, not separate mobile builds.

### Tables → Stacked Cards (Toptal)
On screens below `md` (768px), table rows collapse into **stacked, standalone cards**
(`DataCard` + `DataCardRow` components) so nothing is squished and no horizontal
scrolling is required. On `md`+ the full table renders (`hidden md:block` /
`md:hidden` pairing). Choose per-table:
- **Stacked cards** — when users read one row at a time (schools, codes).
- **Keep table w/ horizontal scroll** — only when column comparison matters.

### Navigation (Toptal)
- **Bottom navigation bar on mobile** — thumb zone, always visible, 4 primary
  destinations (Wallet / Schools / Codes / Generate) with icons.
- **Hamburger drawer** for secondary info (account details) — don't collapse
  everything into it.
- **Top bar** keeps identity/search-level functions; breadcrumbs show position.

### Touch Targets (Toptal — Apple 44pt / Android 48dp)
- Every interactive element: minimum **44×44px** hit area (`.btn-*` all enforce
  `min-h-[44px]`; icon-only buttons also get `.tap-target`).
- Buttons too small to fit side-by-side → collapse into a menu, or stack vertically;
  never just shrink spacing.
- **Kebab/menu pattern** for secondary actions on list rows when space is tight.

### No Hover-Only Interactions (Toptal)
There is no cursor on mobile:
- Tooltips/hover reveals must also work on **tap** or be removed.
- Chart/data hints: use tap-to-reveal with a visible instruction ("Tap to see data").
- `title` attributes may exist for desktop but are never the only affordance.

## 4. Interactive States (Toptal)

Every action gives clear, predictable feedback:

- **Loading** — buttons show progress ("Requesting…", "Generating…", spinner) and are
  disabled while busy. Route-level loading uses a skeleton (`PageSkeleton` in
  `App.tsx`) that matches the KPI card rhythm — never a blank screen.
- **Disabled** — grayed-out with a reason (missing wallet, no selection).
- **Success** — explicit confirmation (`.alert-ok`, "Copied ✓", "Funds sent ✓").
- **Error** — recoverable message (`.alert-danger` / `.alert-warn`), not a dead end.
- **Enabled affordance** — hover/focus styles preserved on desktop
  (`:focus-visible` ring for keyboard users).

## 5. Data Hygiene & Freshness (DataCamp)

- **"Last updated" stamp** on every data view (`LastUpdated` component /
  "Updated hh:mm:ss"), plus a manual Refresh control.
- **Single source of truth** — all numbers read from the governed on-chain contracts;
  never compute the same metric two different ways.
- **Real-time updates** — WebSocket contract events trigger re-fetch so the stamp
  stays honest.
- **Units and precision** — always label units (ETH, days, hours); round to useful
  precision (`formatEth`, `formatDuration`).
- **Ratios for at-a-glance comparison** — KPI cards show a percentage hint
  (`pct()` helper: "{n}% of schools" / "{n}% of all codes") so scales are
  comparable without mental math (Medium: "converting metrics to ratios").

## 6. Color, Contrast & Accessibility (DataCamp)

Color is a **signal, not decoration**:

- One token system (see `tailwind.config.js` / `src/index.css`):
  - `brand` (indigo) — primary actions, active nav.
  - `ok` (green) / `warn` (amber) / `danger` (red) / `neutral` (slate) — reserved
    status meanings only.
  - `ink-*` text tokens, `surface-*` background tokens.
- **Status needs a second cue** — never color alone: StatusBadge always pairs the
  color with a text label ("Active", "Grace period", "Expired"); count KPIs use
  colored text + label, not just color.
- **Accessible contrast** — text tokens are pre-verified against surfaces; test
  dark theme (the only theme) early.
- **Focus visibility** — global `:focus-visible` ring on all interactive elements.

## 7. Consistency & Low Cognitive Load (DataCamp)

- **One component set** — all pages use shared classes: `.btn-brand`,
  `.btn-neutral`, `.btn-outline`, `.card`, `.kpi-card`, `.alert-*`, `.badge-*`,
  `.field-label`/`.field-input`, `.table-*`. Pages must not hard-code raw colors
  (slate/indigo Tailwind literals are legacy — use tokens).
- **Fixed roles for type**: page titles `text-lg/xl font-semibold/bold`;
  labels `text-xs` with `ink-secondary`; data `code-mono` for addresses/hashes.
- **Stable interaction patterns** — filters and refresh always in the same place;
  navigation never moves between tabs.
- **Trim non-data ink** — short labels, rounded numbers, no decorative gridlines.

## 8. Metrics That Drive Action (Medium)

Prioritize metrics by what they let the user *do*:

- **Actionable metrics** — leading indicators tied to actions (valid codes waiting
  for hand-off, expiring licenses).
- **Relative metrics** — change over time (remaining time vs. expiry).
- **Proportional metrics** — share of whole (active vs. grace vs. expired counts).
- **Ratios for comparison** — when scales differ, normalize (counts → percentages).

Every data section connects to its action: expired school → "Regenerate code";
valid code → "Share" / "Deactivate"; no gas → "Request gas".

## 9. Narrative Arc (DataCamp)

Each page reads like a short story — **What changed? → Why? → What do we do now?**

1. Headline numbers (KPI strip).
2. Detail rows explaining the headline (cards/table).
3. Contextual action per row (footer buttons).

## 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid (DataCamp, Medium)

- ❌ Data dumps — more widgets than decisions.
- ❌ Many-slice pie charts (use sorted bars instead).
- ❌ Dual-axis charts (fake correlations; split vertically instead).
- ❌ Numbers without context (no units, no timestamp, no comparison).
- ❌ Hover-only tooltips on mobile.
- ❌ Tables squished onto small screens (horizontal scroll fatigue).
- ❌ Buried primary actions / tiny touch targets.
- ❌ Color as the only status cue.
- ❌ Duplicating the same metric in multiple widgets.
- ❌ Hiding everything behind a hamburger menu.

## 11. Review Loop (DataCamp)

- Task-test with real users: "show me the expired schools", "generate a code for
  school X".
- Fix decision-blockers first: unclear labels, missing comparisons, slow loads.
- Keep a changelog; schedule light monthly reviews (top 3 pain points, top 3 wins).

## Applied Changes in This Codebase

- `src/App.tsx` — added mobile bottom navigation (thumb zone) with icons and
  `aria-current`; 44px+ targets on hamburger/close; `pb-24` so content clears the
  fixed nav.
- `src/index.css` — `.btn-*` now enforce `min-h-[44px]`; added `.tap-target`,
  `.kpi-card/.kpi-label/.kpi-value/.kpi-hint`; global `:focus-visible` ring.
- `src/pages/SchoolsPage.tsx` — KPI strip (Total/Active/Grace/Expired), freshness
  stamp, mobile stacked cards + desktop table.
- `src/pages/CodesPage.tsx` — KPI strip (Total/Valid/Consumed), freshness stamp,
  9-column table becomes stacked cards below `md`, 44px deactivation flow.
- `src/pages/WalletPage.tsx` — token-based styling, KPI hierarchy, full-width mobile
  CTAs, freshness stamp.
- `src/pages/GenerateCodePage.tsx` — token-based styling, mobile stacked school
  cards, full-width generate button, `inputMode="numeric"`.
- `src/components/DataCard.tsx`, `src/components/LastUpdated.tsx` — new shared
  mobile-card and freshness components.
- `src/components/CopyShareButtons.tsx` — `ShareButton` accepts `style` for
  token-based theming.
- `vite.config.ts` — `manualChunks` splits viem, Privy, and React vendors into
  parallel-loading, independently cached chunks (was one 2.6 MB bundle).
- `src/App.tsx` — pages are `lazy()`-loaded behind `Suspense` with a KPI-rhythm
  `PageSkeleton` fallback, so the login screen paints before the web3 bundle
  arrives (perceived performance; interactive states guideline).
- `src/pages/SchoolsPage.tsx`, `src/pages/CodesPage.tsx` — KPI cards gained
  percentage-ratio hints (`pct()` helper) for at-a-glance comparison.
- `src/lib/kpi.ts` — shared, unit-tested metric helpers (`pct`,
  `schoolStatusCounts`, `codeStateCounts`, `applyCodeFilter`); single source of
  truth for KPI math and the codes filter.
- `src/lib/kpi.test.ts` + `npm test` — vitest suite covering the KPI helpers,
  every filter branch (`All` / `Unused` / `Consumed`), filter validation
  (`parseCodeFilter`), and search behavior (`searchCodes`: code text, school
  name, whitespace, composition with the filter).
- `src/pages/CodesPage.tsx` — KPI cards became clickable filter shortcuts (with
  `{shownCount} shown` on the Total card); added the code/school search input;
  filter choice persists via `localStorage`
  (`autoschool360.codesFilter`) with safe parsing on read; search query also
  persists (`autoschool360.codesSearch`); **"✕ Clear filter & search"** reset
  button appears only when the view is narrowed (`hasActiveViewState`).
